We parked at the [picnic area](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/picnic-areas/dangars-falls-picnic-area), then did the [walk](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/mcdirtys-walking-track) to the lookout. A series of steps took us to a viewing platform right over the cascades of Dangers Falls.

Dangar Falls is a cascade waterfall located across the Bielsdown River about 1.2 km north of Dorrigo. The falls are small, picturesque, and are a popular photographic subject. For a short time after rain, they are quite spectacular. We were lucky to see them flowing strongly.

From the lookout, we went along to the the Rock Wallaby lookout along [McDirtys Walk](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/mcdirtys-walking-track). From the spectacular Rock Wallaby lookout, we saw unending scenic views of the deep river gouged ravines.
