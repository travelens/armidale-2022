Today the weather was good so we decided to venture a little further afield. We decided we will revisit Gara Gorge since the last time we were not able to walk far because of the wet conditions.

On the way there, we encountered a set of very stubborn cows on Blue Hole Rd. They absolutely did not want to give way, and I had to inch the car forward slowly until they yielded.
