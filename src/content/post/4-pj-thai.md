Found a Thai restaurant in Armidale - [PJ Thai](https://www.pjthai.com.au/). The proprietor is hilarious (in a good way). Our fried rice was accidentally served onto a different table, and when he realised he nearly freaked out. I think he was going to force the other table to give the rice to us, but they have already started eating it. We overheard him asking the kitchen to cook another batch of fried rice quickly.
