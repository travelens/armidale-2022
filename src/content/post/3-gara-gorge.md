Today we decided to explore the 185km Waterfall Way scenic drive which links Coffs harbour and Armidale, passing rainforest, river valleys and waterfalls, including New England and Dorrigo national parks.

First stop is [Gara Gorge](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/lookouts/gara-gorge-lookout).

We drove to the Threlfall picnic area, which is just off Waterfall Way near Armidale and on the northern edge of Oxley Wild Rivers National Park.

As the grounds were quite wet from recent rain (in fact it was drizzling whilst we were there), we just did a short loop around the picnic area and the nearby Blue Hole. We explored the remains of the old dam at Gara Gorge and the Blue Hole.

Normally, the Gara river is quiet and calm, but after the recent rains it has become a raging rapid! We also saw some classic New England granite boulders here and beautiful wildflowers.
