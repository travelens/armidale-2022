Can you believe I have never been to [Taco Bell](https://tacobell.com.au/) before, not here, not in the US? The food wasn't too bad.

Taco Bell originated in California, United States of America. It was founded by Glen Bell, and he opened the first Taco Bell restaurant back in 1962 in Downey, California. Before Taco Bell, he originally owned and operated a hamburger stand called Bellâ€™s Hamburgers in California, built in 1948 on the border of San Bernardino and the city of Colton. Glen opened his first taco stand, Taco Tia in 1954, selling tacos for nineteen cents (AUD$2.17 value today).
