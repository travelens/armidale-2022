[Rydges Armidale](https://www.rydges.com/accommodation/regional-nsw/armidale/) is Armidaleâ€™s premier 4.5 star hotel, offering stylish accommodation, warm professional service and delicious cuisine at Azka Restaurant or Wine & Tapas Bar.

We decided to have a lavish dinner at the restaurant. I had steak, and Lyn had the barramundi. After that, we had sticky date pudding for dessert.
