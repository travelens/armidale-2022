[Chaffey Dam](https://www.waternsw.com.au/nsw-dams/regional-nsw-dams/chaffey-dam) is unique in inland NSW for its distinctive brick-red rock wall made of semi-precious stone and its unusual morning glory spillway. The lake and its foreshores are a popular destination for water sports and fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers, bushwalkers, campers and picnickers. The main purpose of the dam is to supply irrigation and stock needs in the Peel River Valley of northern NSW, and to supply water to the city of Tamworth.

Chaffey Dam is situated on the Peel River, 43 kilometres south-east of Tamworth in the New England region of NSW. The dam is about 400 kilometres north of Sydney.
