This magnificent building replaced the modest picturesque St Mary’s Cathedral which
graced the site from 1872-1912. On 5 February the foundation stone of a larger and
statelier Cathedral was laid. Sydney Architects, Sheerin and Hennessey, drew up plans
based on a basilica, the Roman-style court. Contract to build the Cathedral was won by
George Frederick Nott of Armidale. For a short time the two cathedrals stood side-by-
side, until the present gothic revival-styled building with its steep roof, lofty spire and
castellated parapets took pride of place. Dedicated on 6 October 1912 it remains one
of Armidale’s foremost landmarks. Open for general access seven days, 7.00am-
6.00pm.
