After Wollombi Falls, it started to rain quite heavily, so decided not to stop anymore and just drove the remainder of Waterfall Way to Ebor, then returned via an alternate route (Guyra Rd), and then cut back to Armidale via Rockdale Rd. The road was unsealed all the way, and it was quite an adventure following it, and we were glad when we started seeing signs of civilisation once more.

After that, we decided to have dinner at [Hao Sushi & Grill](https://www.haosushiandgrill.com/), located next to the Wicklow Hotel. We ordered chicken teriyaki and an unagi bento box. I was very surprised when the bento box arrived with no unagi in it! Fortunately, I managed to get another bowl with unagi. We also ordered some salmon sushi as entree.
