[The Whitebull](https://www.whitebull.net.au) is a traditional country hotel, redeveloped into a steakhouse. There is the beautiful rope room with a mix of high and low seating to enjoy that casual dining experience. This is complimented by the old world lounge area with a traditional bar and beautifully restored fireplaces for those classic New England winters.

We had the steak and chicken schnitzel here and it was an enjoyable meal to celebrate the end of our trip to Armidale.
