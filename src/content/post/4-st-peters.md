In 1850 the small timber church of St Peter was built on the northern side of
Central Park. Horbury Hunt was engaged to design and supervise construction
of a cathedral in Armidale in 1869. The foundation stones were laid on
22 May 1873 when a parchment describing the proceedings was placed in a
metal cylinder between the stones which are under the flying buttress on the
north side of the building. The Cathedral was opened on 3 June 1875 and later
additions have been the lower belfry, chapter house and vestry. Memorial
stained-glass windows recall many parishioners and a small museum contains
ecclesiastical memorabilia. A ring of eight bells was installed and dedicated in
October 1996. Open for general access Monday-Friday, 9.00am-12.30pm.
