Oxley Scenic Lookout is a highlight of any visit to Tamworth. We followed Tamworthâ€™s jacaranda-lined White St to the very top, and reached this viewpoint. The lookout, originally Oxley Park, is named in honour of John Oxley, Surveyor General and explorer, who passed through the Tamworth area in 1818.

The views are almost 180 degrees and stretch for kilometres into the distance providing incredible views of both the city and Peel River Valley.

The Lookout is surrounded by natural bushland and is the base camp for the Kamilaroi Walking Track, which winds its way through the bushland of Oxley Park linking the Botanic Garden, Marsupial Park, Oxley Lookout and Flagstaff Mountain over a distance of several kilometres.
