[Barraba](https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/country-nsw/tamworth-area/barraba) is a little country town surrounded by the Nandewar Ranges and the Horton Valley, tucked into a bend of the Manilla River. The town was established in the late 1800s on the back of grazing and the gold rush, named for the Kamilaroi word meaning “camping place on the edge of a river”.

With its tree-lined streets, heritage buildings and old fashioned shop fronts, Barraba is a delightful historic mining town. We liked the mix of colonial and art deco architecture on Queen Street.

We walked around and visited the clock tower, Art Deco playhouse, and various turn of the century buildings. It also has many interesting shop window displays as the Barraba show is on in Friday.

I always find small town residents to be ever so polite and friendly. One woman noticed me peering at the dresses in the frock shop and thought I wanted to buy one. She told me the shop is closed because the proprietor's mother had just died, but if I knocked on the door, the proprietor will probably open it for me. I said thanks, but I am okay.
