Wollomombi Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Wollomombi River in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. It is approximately 1.45 kilometres (0.90 mi) off the Waterfall Way, on top of the Wollomombi Gorge near the confluence of the Wollomombi River with the Chandler River. Nearby is the Chandler Falls on the Chandler River. The falls descend from an elevation of 907 metres (2,976 ft) above sea level (AHD) in one drop of 100 metres (330 ft), with a total descent that ranges in height between 150–230 metres (490–750 ft) depending on the flow of the river. It is the highest waterfall in NSW and the second highest in Australia.

The [Wollomombi Main Falls lookout](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/lookouts/wollomombi-main-falls-lookout) is a 200m walk from Wollomombi Falls picnic area. After passing through towering stringybark and blackbutt forest, we reached the large viewing platform of Wollomombi Main Falls lookout. From here we enjoyed sweeping vistas across a rugged and beautiful landscape.

After that, we went on the [Chandler walking track](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/chandler-walking-track) from the Wollomombi Falls picnic area. The track doesn’t lead to Chandler River anymore, due to erosion, however the brilliant views from Checks lookout are not to be missed.

From Wollomombi lookout, we gazed across the spectacular waterfall where water plunges dramatically into the ravine below. From here, the track leads through woodlands of stringybarks and blackbutts. Another lookout allowed us to gaze across the maze of gorges and valleys.

The falls were looking better than any tourist brochure due to the heavy rain. This is what I imagined Rivendell would look like! We walked all the way around the rim, down to Chandler river, crossed a partially collapsed bridge (It was an Indiana Jones moment) to the top of both falls.

It was drizzling when we started but the rain settled into a solid pour. We were actually above the cloud level so it was strange to walk in the cloud. I have a picture of myself soaking wet at the top of Chandler Falls to prove we did it!
