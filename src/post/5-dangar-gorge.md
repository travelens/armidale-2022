We parked at the [picnic area](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/picnic-areas/dangars-falls-picnic-area), then did the [walk](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/mcdirtys-walking-track) to the lookout. A series of steps took us to a viewing platform right over the cascades of Dangers Falls.

Dangar Falls is a cascade waterfall located across the Bielsdown River about 1.2 km north of Dorrigo. The falls are small, picturesque, and are a popular photographic subject. For a short time after rain, they are quite spectacular. We were lucky to see them flowing strongly.

From the lookout, we went along to the the Rock Wallaby lookout along [McDirtys Walk](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/mcdirtys-walking-track). From the spectacular Rock Wallaby lookout, we saw unending scenic views of the deep river gouged ravines.

The scenery looked like something out of Tolkien. We were last here over 25 years ago, and all I had was a film SLR with a 35-80mm zoom lens, and I really wished I had an ultra wide angle lens to capture the full perspective of the long falls, the pool at the bottom and the horseshoe gorge. Luckily I am a little better equipped these days. Some of these shots were captured at 12mm. Once again butterflies accompanied us on the walk.
